### Contents

This folder contains codes and example data for a simple interactive web app displaying forecasts and a ranking of participants. It can be run using the command runApp in R or, if using RStudio, the "Play" button shown upon opening ui.R or server.R. The app is implemented in R Shiny and requires the following packages: DT (tested with version 0.25); htmlwidgets (1.5.4); plotly (4.10.0);  shiny (1.7.2).

The specific contents of the folder are as follows:

- ui.R - Defines the user interface of the R Shiny app
- server.R - Defines the server logic of the R Shiny app
- plot_data - Contains all data necessary for plotting
   - list_models.csv - A csv file containing the names of all models which shall be shown in the app. This needs to be adapted manually if models are added.
   - plot_data_YYYY-MM_DD.csv - Forecasts submitted for different models at date YYYY-MM_DD.
   - rankings.csv - Average ranks for different targets to be shown in the rankings table below the plot.
   - temperature.csv - The observed temperature time series (at noon at Berlin-Tempelhof weather station).
   - wind.csv - The observed wind speed time series (at noon at Berlin-Tempelhof weather station).

### Data source

The observation data for temperature and wind speed at Berlin-Tempelhof included in the files '/ptsfc_viz/plot_data/temperature.csv' and '/ptsfc_viz/plot_data/wind.csv' were obtained from the Climate Data Center of the German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) at https://www.dwd.de/EN/climate_environment/cdc/cdc_node_en.html. DWD allows the use of these datasets without restrictions in accordance with the "Verordnung zur Festlegung der Nutzungsbestimmungen f√ºr die Bereitstellung von Geodaten des Bundes (GeoNutzV)" (Regulation for the Determination of the Conditions of Use for the Provision of Geodata of the Federal Government (GeoNutzV)) with the addition of a source note.
